
Riemann Solver
==============

Here are some of the first questions, issues and comments, I had while solving the tasks of the first week.


Issues / Questions
------------------

Does VisIt have anti-aliasing? Additionally, the titles on the curves are pretty distracting.

.. figure:: w1_visit_tsunami.png


Doxygen: has issues with included .h-files: thinks that their description & license is relevant, and then warns about multiple occurrences.

.. figure:: w1_doxygen_warnings.png

Sphinx expects "index.rst", while Github expects "README.rst"/"README.md". Combine them elegantly somehow?

Sphinx seems to not be installed on the server (sphinx-quickstart: command not found, sphinx-build: command not found).

The task description suggests to assume the gravity constant as 9.81m/s², while the sample code including samples with ~9.80665m/s², so I had to add a little inaccuracy to WavePropagation1d.test.cpp to make the test match both approximations. It shouldn't break anything.

Worked fine
-----------

Doxygen documentation

Sphinx documentation

Writing the implementation, and writing tests

I first had issues to find the correct options in ParaView, but then got it working :).
